#Gym Exercise to do list

With this project I build for people to create list exercise need to do. This project I buid with backend and frontend

In backend I use mongooDB to save information of user, in here I build to schema, first is collection to save list of exercise and second is list to save all information of user. So User need to have account to create list of exercise. For coding of backend, I use node js is enviroment to run project and express js to create API for interact with user, besides I use Json Web Token to authorization the user who interact with app.

In frontend I use react js is library to build the client site. With reducer and context hook I can implement the logic and pass all data to each component child and use react router dom to create the route for each page of client page. 

Install dependency project: go to backend and frontend folder and type 

    npm i || npm install

Run app: 
    
    cd backend: npm start
    
    cd frontend: npm start
